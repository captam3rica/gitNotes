# Profile Time Schedules 

## Process

1.  Define a time.
2.  Apply time schedule to profile

### Define Time Schedule

Go to **`Devices > Profiles & Resources > Profiles Settings > Time Schedules`**

1.  Select **Add Schedule** above **Schedule Name** column
2.  Select **Add Schedule** under the **Day of the Week** column, then configure
    the following:

    -   **Schedule Name**
    -   **Time Zone**
    -   **Day of the Week**
    -   **All Day**: force profile install at Midnight on day selected

business hours and combine with a payload that restricts access to certain
sites. 

Go to **`Devices > Profiles & Resources > Profiles > ADD > select your Platform`**

1.  Select **Enable Scheduling and install only during selected time periods**
    on the **General** tab.

2.  In the **Assigned Schedules** box, enter one or more time schedules to this
    profile.

    to apply only while devices are inside the time frame.
