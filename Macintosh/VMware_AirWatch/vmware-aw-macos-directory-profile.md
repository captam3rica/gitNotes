-   Binding a device to a directory service will force that device to comply with
    directory policies and password security settings. Therefore, it is
    recommended that the password policy not be managed in AW.

-   A device can be bound to multiple directory services by pushing multiple
    profiles to it. 

Go to **`Divices > Profiles & Resources > Profiles > Add > Apple macOS > Device
Profile`**

1.  Configure General settings 

2.  Select the **Directory** payload. Then, choose a **directory type**, Open
    Directory or AD.

    **Note**: If multiple policies enforce different rules, the one that is most
    restrictive will take precedence.

3.  Configure **Auth** settings

-   **Directory Type**: AD or Open Directory or LDAP

-   **Configure a mobile account at login**: users data will be stored locally
    on the device.
