## Service Considerations

### Top Case

**Early 2015**

For Early 2015 models: The top case includes the battery, BMU, keyboard, microphone, trackpad flex cable, and trackpad.

**Late 2013 & Mid 2014**

For Late 2013 and Mid 2014 models: The top case includes the battery, BMU, keyboard, microphone, and trackpad.

**Late 2013 & Early 2013**

For Late 2012 and Early 2013 models: The top case comes with the battery, BMU, keyboard, microphone, and small removable parts such as Mylar BMU cover, screws, flexures, and clutch screw covers.

### Trackpad Calibration Check (Early 2015 Only)

To verify that the trackpad is responding as expected, run the Trackpad Calibration Check after every repair or whenever the computer has been reassembled.

### BMU Interlock Screw

The BMU interlock screw is a shoulder screw with a gold-plated washer (pictured). It is the washer that helps complete the signal and enables power to flow from the battery to the logic board. The battery is built-in and connected to the logic board by the BMU. The BMU interlock screw MUST BE REMOVED before performing service procedures. If you fail to do so, current from the battery may short circuit the components and render the logic board and/or the battery unusable.

### Keyboard Backlight Flex Cable

Remember to unplug the keyboard backlight flex cable

### Wireless Card

The wireless card comes with a thermal pad attached to the underside. When lifting the card from the logic board, check that the pad remains with the card. The thermal pad is available as a separate service part.

### Bottom Case Reassembly Screw Order

### Interposer (Late 2012 & Early 2013 Only)

The interposer is available as a separate service part (661-7045). Use only ESD-safe nonconductive interposer tweezers (included in kit 076-1411) to remove, transfer, or install the interposer. The only parts that require removal of the interposer are logic board assembly (with MagSafe, heat sink, fan ducts, and fans attached), logic board, MagSafe, audio board, trackpad, and top case.

### Fan Ducts on Heat Sink

The fan ducts are rubber gaskets that wrap around the heat sink. The heat sink must be removed to access the fans and replace the fan ducts.

### Trackpad with Cable (Late 2012 & Early 2013 Only)

The trackpad comes with the trackpad cable attached. If the trackpad cable needs to be replaced, you must replace the trackpad.
