### Required Materials

**Personal Protective Equipment**

- Nitrile/latex gloves
- Heat-resistant gloves
- Safety glasses
- Cleaning wipes (to clean your safety glasses before wearing)
- Cut-resistant gloves (although not specific to battery safety, these should be stored in the safety kit for handling things like broken glass)

**Required Materials**

- 8-10 cups of clean, dry, untreated sand in quick-pour dispenser
- Hand broom with dust pan
- Existing ESD bags or resealable, plastic disposal bags (such as ZipLoc®), and boxes (large enough to fit a case assembly with built-in battery)
- Yellow fire-proof safety cabinet

### Battery Covers for Portables

**Best Practice**

- Immediately after opening the computer (removing the bottom case)
- Before beginning battery removal (or case assembly with built-in battery removal)
- Prior to installing a replacement battery (if a cover is not already attached)
- When preparing to package a battery for shipment

### Responding to Battery Events

**Hot Battery Response**  

- Clear work bench of any materials or debris.
- Put on heat-resistant gloves and safety glasses.
- In the case of an external short circuit, unplug the computer's power adapter. The battery should immediately start to cool.
- Wearing heat-resistant gloves, pick up the battery or case assembly with battery, and place it in the fire-proof safety cabinet for at least 2 hours. (If the battery is not easily removed, place the entire system in the yellow fire-proof safety cabinet.)
- Return batteries according to Apple Recycle and scrap procedures. See "Return/Recycle Procedures" in this training.

**Swelling Battery Response**

- If a soft cell battery has suddenly started to swell, this is an indication that a potentially serious situation might be developing. Pour all of the sand, all at once, over the battery to cover it completely. This will smother any potential reaction. Timing is critical; the faster you pour the sand, the faster the reaction will be contained.
- Leave the room for 30 minutes, if necessary for comfort. Meanwhile, let the cell rest during that time.
- Put on heat-resistant gloves and safety glasses.
- Remove the product and any debris, if present, from the sand. Place the item(s) into the yellow fire-proof safety cabinet for a minimum of 2 hours.
- If employees are injured or were exposed as a result of the swelling battery event, notify management of the incident.
- Sweep up sand. Pour it back into dispenser for reuse. Add more sand to refill the dispenser, if necessary.
- Wipe down the affected area with water. Use an ESD mat cleaning solution on the affected area.
- Dispose of the damaged product/battery, including any debris removed from sand, according to Apple Recycles and scrap procedures. See “Return/Recycle - Procedures” in this training course.
- Order more sand from your regional supply vendor.

**Venting Battery Response**

- If you notice a battery is venting gases (not thermal runaway), or if you notice any unusual odors coming from the battery, leave it on the bench and evacuate the room for 15 minutes.
- Upon reentering room, note any unusual odors. Leave the room for an additional 15 minutes if odors are strong or irritating in any way.
- Once odors are diminished within the room, put on nitrile or latex gloves and safety glasses.
- Prepare a disposal bag, such as an ESD bag or a resealable, plastic disposal bag (such as ZipLoc®).
- Clear work bench of any materials or debris.
- If still connected, unplug the power adapter.
- Place the battery or case assembly with battery into the disposal bag and seal the bag.
- Put the bag containing the battery into the yellow fire-proof safety cabinet.
- Return batteries according to Apple Recycles and scrap procedures.  See "Return/Recycle Procedures" in this training.
- If employees were injured or feel ill, notify management of the incident.

**Leakage Event Response**

- Clear work bench of any materials or debris.
- Prepare a resealable, plastic disposal bag (such as ZipLoc®). Do not use an ESD bag.
- Put on nitrile (or equivalent) gloves and safety glasses.
- Pick up the battery / case assembly with battery.
- Place the battery / case assembly with battery into the resealable, plastic disposal bag and seal. Place in yellow fire-proof safety cabinet temporarily.
- Wipe down the affected area with water. Use an ESD mat cleaning solution on the affected area.
- Return batteries according to Apple Recycles and scrap procedures. See "Return/Recycle Procedures" in this training.
- If employees were injured or feel ill, notify management of the incident.

**Thermal Event Response**

**NOTE**: A battery with a state of charge less than 25% will be unable to produce a thermal event.

- Immediately upon noticing that a battery thermal event is occurring, pour all the sand, all at once, over the battery to cover it completely, smothering the reaction and limiting smoke produced. Timing is critical; the faster you pour all the sand, the faster the thermal runaway will stop.
- If sand is not used, the thermal reaction is self-limiting and should extinguish itself in under 30 seconds. Smoke may continue to be emitted from the battery for up to a minute longer.
- Leave the room for 30 minutes, if necessary for comfort. Meanwhile, let the cell rest during that time.
- Once the reaction has been smothered and the battery has had time to cool (~30 minutes), put on heat-resistant gloves and safety glasses.
- Remove the product and any debris from the sand. Place the item(s) into the yellow fire-proof safety cabinet for a minimum of 2 hours.
- If employees were injured or feel ill, notify management of the incident.
- Sweep up sand. Pour it back into dispenser for reuse. Add more sand to refill the dispenser, if necessary.
- Wipe down the affected area with water. Use an ESD mat cleaning solution on the affected area.
- Dispose of the damaged product/battery (including any debris removed from sand) according to Apple Recycles and scrap procedures. See "Return/Recycle Procedures" in this training course.
- Order more sand from your regional supply vendor.

### First Aid Response

**Inhalation**

- Move the affected person to fresh air.
- If irritation persists, seek medical attention.

**Skin or eye contact**

- Remove and isolate contaminated clothing.
- In case of contact with internal battery materials or fluids, immediately flush skin or eyes with cool running water in bathroom sink for 10 minutes or longer if possible.
- If irritation persists, seek medical attention.

### Return/Recycle Procedures


**Best Practice**

If listed transportation options are not available in your location, recycle or dispose of these batteries according to local laws and regulations. If recycling or disposal options are not available in your country, storing these batteries may be appropriate. If you are unsure, please contact ACS for more information.
