# Trackpad Calibration Check  

**Avoiding False Negative Results**

The trackpad calibration component of AST 2 requires that the unit under test be isolated from vibration. To ensure valid results, follow these instructions:

- Do NOT test computer on a workbench that is being shared by another technician. Any vibration of the bench by a colleague will invalidate the calibration results.
- Do NOT lean on workbench during the calibration. You can cause vibrations in the workbench if you touch it.
- Do NOT drop weights while moving them during calibration.
- Do NOT place one weight on bench when switching from 200g to 800g weights during calibration.
- Place the rubber template on the trackpad before launching the test in AST 2. This establishes the correct baseline for the weights.
- Do NOT use tape on the template.


**Calibration Process**

The Force Touch trackpad calibration requires weight placements for each weight used on the trackpad:

1. 200g weight on six checkpoints.
2. 800g weight on six checkpoints.

AST 2 provides instructions throughout the process for each weight placement.

*The calibration process takes several minutes. All steps in the process must be completed.*

If performed incorrectly, a false negative occurs and the process must be repeated.
