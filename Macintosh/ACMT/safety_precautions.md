# Macintosh Safety Precautions

### Electrical Safety Precautions

Before working on a computer with exposed, potentially energized parts:

- Remove rings, watches, necklaces, metal-rimmed eyewear, and other metallic articles which increase your risk of electric shock.
- Do not wear a cell phone or other signaling device, as these may cause a dangerous startle reflex during energized work.
- **If the iMac needs to be plugged in for LED checks or similar troubleshooting, do NOT wear an ESD wrist strap.** Wearing ESD grounding systems increases your risk of electric shock.
- Remain alert, focused on the work being performed, and aware of the proximity of grounded objects to your body.
- Use the plastic black stick or other nonmetal extension tool as needed to connect or disconnect cables, to keep fingers away from potentially energized parts.

### Handling Cracked Glass on the Display Panel (iMac 2012-2017)

The glass on the front of the iMac (2017) display panel is not tempered and must be handled carefully.

If this glass is cracked, you should follow the procedures in TP819 - Cleaning and Handling a Broken Display Panel.

#### Tools you will need include:  

- Safety glasses
- Material handling gloves (such as leather, glass-handling or cut-resistant gloves)
- Packing tape
