- **Customer-Facing Diagnostics**

    - **Apple Hardware Test (AHT)**
    Applies to MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012 and Early 2013) only. Shipped with Mac computers introduced prior to June 2013. Contains suite of diagnostics that will test the computer's hardware.

    - **Apple Diagnostics**
    Shipped with Mac computers introduced on or after June 2013. Helps to identify the potential source of a hardware issue and provides first steps to try to resolve it.

### When to Use Specific Tools

- Initial Troubleshooting - use Apple Diagnostics with the customer
- If presented by the customer, lookup AD diagnostic codes. Then, run AST to gain a more complete picture.
- If another tech is performing a repair, they should run AST to familiarize themselves with he issues at hand.
- Run AST to confirm that new components are installed correctly
- Run ASD after assembly and repair have been completed. **This works for everything except for MBP early 2015**
- Run AST to demonstrate that the repair was successful

## Before Beginning a Repair

- Confirm right version of Mac OS and that all software and firmware are up-to-date
- Run AST to start the initial diagnostic process
- Follow standard take apart tips

## Battery Cover & BMU Screw (Late 2012 and Early 2013)

- Remove one (6.88mm) 923-0291 BMU interlock screw AND gold-plated washer
- Whenever the hinged screw cover is removed, you must remove the existing adhesive cap inside the screw cover. If any adhesive remains on the screw head or inside the cover, peel it away with a black stick. Apply a new adhesive cap to the inside of the screw cover before replacing it.

## Battery Cover (Late 2013 to Early 2015)

## Top Case Assembly (Late 2012 and Early 2013)

- Battery
- Keyboard
- Microphone
- BMU (battery management unit)
- Small removable parts such as mylar BMU cover, screws, flexures, and clutch screw covers

**Parts**

- BMU Cover (923-0258)
- Clutch Screw Cover, Right (923-0259)
- Clutch Screw Cover, Left (923-0260)

## Top Case Assembly (Late 2013 to Early 2015)

- Battery
- Keyboard
- Microphone
- Trackpad
- Trackpad cable (included with the MacBok Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015))

**Note:**  Screws, flexures, and clutch screw covers are included with replacement top case assemblies.

## Force Touch Trackpad (Early 2015)

- Calibrate the track pad after a top case replacement

### Calibration Equipment

- Fully assembled computer with the Force Touch trackpad
- Wireless Internet access
- Diagnostic console (iPad, Mac, or Windows device with a supported web browser)
- Local NetBoot server with the required AST 2 NetBoot resources
- 800-gram and 200-gram trackpad weight set (923-00462)
- Weight placement rubber template (923-00599)
- Stable work surface (free from the slightest vibration)

### Avoiding False Positives

- Do NOT test computer on a workbench that is being shared by another technician. - Any vibration of the bench by a colleague will invalidate the calibration - results.
- Do NOT lean on workbench during the calibration. You can cause vibrations in the workbench by touching it.
- Do NOT drop weights while moving them during calibration.
- Do NOT place one weight on bench when switching from 200g to 800g weights - during calibration.
- **Place the rubber template on the trackpad before launching the test in AST 2. This establishes the correct baseline for the weights.**
- Do NOT use tape on the template.

## Service Considerations

**MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013 to Early 2015) Specifics**

The MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013 to Early 2015) does not utilize the following parts:

- Audio Board
- Fan Ducts
- Interposer
- BMU Interlock Screw

**Note:** The trackpad is built into the top case assembly. It cannot be replaced separately.

**Sleep Status**

The MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014, Early 2015) does not have a sleep LED. To troubleshoot without one:

- Connect a USB device that has a power-on or activity LED. As power is restored - to the USB and the system wakes from sleep, the LED lights up.
- Press the Caps Lock key multiple times to wake computer from sleep.
- Open display and press an alphanumeric key to wake computer from sleep.
- A computer that has been asleep for an extended period can consume the - remaining charge of the battery. Restore power to computer with known-good - power adapter, and check that MagSafe indicator light shows an in-progress - battery charge. The computer will boot from a hibernation file and start up - from where it left off.
- Resetting SMC instantly shuts down computer with these side effects.
    - If computer is in sleep mode, it will reboot from a hibernation file.
    - If computer is booted to Mac OS during the SMC reset, data from open - applications can be lost.
    - If computer is already shut down, there will be no side effects.

**Liquid Contact Indicators**

**Wireless Card**

- Make sure that thermal pad remains intact while removing wireless card

**Speaker Replacement**

- Right and left speakers are paired and only come as a kit
- **Applicable only to MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012 and Early 2013)**

    Carefully remove tiny mesh foam cover from middle (corner) screw using black stick and tweezers. The foam cover is necessary for grounding. A new cover comes with speaker replacement kit and must be applied after speaker installation.

    **Note** - save the foam cover

**Replacement SSD Card or Flash Storage**

Before installing a replacement card in the computer, peel off the compliance label attached to the underside of the card:

**I/O Board and Other Modules (Early 2015)**]

Before installing the I/O board or other modules, check that these two foam gaskets are installed in the top case. The smaller gasket is not adhered to the top case and could fall out during a repair process.

## Serial Numbers

**Transferring the System Serial Number**

When replacing a bottom case, retain the user’s original bottom case until the repair is complete. Before installing EITHER a replacement top case or a bottom case, use a fine-tipped permanent marker to write the original system serial number inside the bottom case.
